A concept project to explore AI use in Business Management 
# AI-Powered Business Dashboard – Concept Starter

## 🔍 Overview
This is a concept project I’m developing as part of my learning journey fom Previous Academy & My current aspiration  at PLP Academy. It explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be integrated into Business Management systems to make better, data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Project Goal
To design and eventually build a basic AI-powered dashboard for small businesses that can:
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Predict inventory needs or sales trends
- Recommend actions using basic AI/ML models

## 🧠 Inspiration
With a background in Business Management and a PGD in Business Management with AI Integration from EBU Luxembourg, I’m passionate about using technology to simplify decision-making and improve business efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools I Plan to Use
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend)
- Python (for basic AI logic)
- Flask or Streamlit (for backend visualization – later stage)
- GitHub for version control
- Possibly Excel or mock data for simulations

## 📅 Project Stage
📌 **Currently in planning and learning phase.**  
I'll gradually build this as I learn more from the PLP Academy.

## 📚 Learning Objectives
- Understand how to structure a project on GitHub
- Learn the basics of web development and data visualization
- Explore simple Python-based AI concepts for business
- Practice documenting and updating progress
